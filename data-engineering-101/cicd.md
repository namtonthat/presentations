# 🔄 `ELT` - `EL` step
## Fivetran
- Managed PaaS to capture data into warehousing. 
- Uses CDC
- Ensuring consistent data pipeline performance
- [Live Demo](https://fivetran.com/welcome/select-source?groupId=splashy_decathlon)
 
---

# 🔄 `ELT` - `T` step
## `dbt`
- Streamlining SQL transformations with linage and integration with a lot of data governance
- Implementing version control and testing


---

# 🔄 `ELT` - `T` step
## `dbt`
### Sample script 
```
with customers as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_customers') }}

),

orders as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}

)
```

---

# 🔄 `ELT` - the glue between `EL` and `T`
## Airflow - orchestrator

- Orchestrating complex data workflows
- Scheduling and monitoring with CI/CD practices
- [Live Demo](http://airflow-dev.skinfra.xyz:8080/home?search=workday)

# 🚀 Invoking CI/CD Pipelines

- Automating actions and behaviours
- *What do you think would be good triggers for CI/CD?*

Uses:
- Testing previous uses cases 
- Maintaining coding best practices via `flake8`, `bandit` and `black`
