# ðŸŽ¯ Planned CI/CD
- Goals:
    - Reduce the time to build by 50%

- Achieved by:
    1. Sync `DAGs`/ `variables` into `ga-data-airflow-dags-{env}` S3 bucket.
    2. Splitting the Dockerfile into a multi stage build
      - `airflow_base`: for requirements
      - `airflow_release`: for `entrypoint.sh` / `airflow.cfg` changes
    3. Update `entrypoint.sh` using `aws s3 sync` to sync DAGs back

- *Other changes*:
    - Using SEEK's open source software plugins (`seek-oss/docker-ecr-publish`)

# ðŸŽ¯ Planned CI/CD - `master`
Difference between `develop` and `master` is that each PR is a **squash and merge**.
